## Usage
In your Forward Renderer asset, add the "Anaglyph Feature" render feature and change settings as desired.

| Property | Information |
| ----- | ----- |
| `Render Pass Event` | Leave at `Before Rendering Post Processing` for best results. |
| `Layer Mask` | Which layers to include when rendering the effect. |
| `Shader` | The anaglpyh shader, located at the root directory of the package. |
| `Spacing` | The spacing between the red and cyan channels.<br/>A value of `0` will ignore the focal point.  This is useful for orthographic cameras.<br/>A negative value will swap the red and cyan. |
| `Focal Point` | The point `x` units in front of the camera where the red and cyan channels meet. |
| `Overlay Mode` | `None` - Replace the background with the effect.  This is ideal for rendering the entire screen with the effect.<br/>`Opacity` - Overlay the effect based on its opacity.<br/>`Depth` - Overlay the effect based on its depth. |
| `Blend Mode` | `None` - Do not blend the effect onto the background.<br/>`Additive` - Perform stylistic blending by adding the effect to the background.<br/>`Channel` - Perform correct blending based on each eye's channels. |
| `Opacity Overlay Render Texture Format` | The render texture format to use when `Overlay Mode` is set to `Opacity`. |
| `Depth Overlay Buffer Bit Count` | The depth buffer bit count to use when `Overlay Mode` is set to `Depth`. |

## Notes
- Rendering with this effect may be expensive, since the whole screen must be rendered multiple times every frame.
- `Overlay Mode > Opacity` requires a transparent render texture format, which can be set with `Opacity Overlay Render Texture Format`.
- `Overlay Mode > Depth` does not work with transparent objects, such as text with TextMesh Pro.
